### Hello! 👋

I am a Solution Architect at Amazon Web Services (AWS), working with startups to design and build scalable cloud solutions. With a background in software engineering and architecture, I work closely with teams on a wide range of technical challenges and complex systems.

Specialized in Generative AI and agentic applications, helping companies apply best practices through hands-on insights. I like solving real-world problems with new technologies and building demos that show their value.

Outside of work I enjoy handball, traveling, and photography. Home Automation enthusiast & full-time nerd!
